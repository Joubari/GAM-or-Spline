# GAM-or-Spline
A comparison between GAM and Spline Regression model
This project involves building a regression model to analyze and explain the patterns in individuals' weights based on their heights, age, and sex. The dataset used for this analysis is "weight_height.csv," which contains measurements of individuals' heights, weights, ages, and genders.

The primary objective is to develop a parsimonious regression model, one that is sufficiently complex to explain the data while avoiding unnecessary complexity. This README provides an overview of the project, its goals, and the steps taken to achieve them.
Data Exploration
The first step in building the regression model was to explore the dataset thoroughly. This involved data visualization, including histograms and scatterplots, to understand the relationships between weight and other variables such as height, age, and sex. We aimed to identify any significant trends or patterns in the data.
Conclusion
This project successfully builds a regression model to explain the patterns in individuals' weights based on their heights, ages, and genders. The chosen model provides a concise yet effective explanation of the data, striking a balance between complexity and interpretability
